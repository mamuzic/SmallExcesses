# SmallExcesses
Framework for large scale reinterpretation of ATLAS analyses with a small excess

## Framework for studies of small excesses using ATLAS analyses and pMSSM models
Initial code for finding a connection of small excesses in an analytical way in Run1 Phenomenological Minimal Supresymmetry (pMSSM) scan. The input are Run1 SUSY analyses and pMSSM models [SUSY-2014-08](https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/SUSY-2014-08/).
